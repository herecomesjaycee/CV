## [Jaycee Cheong](https://herecomesjaycee.com)
I am a fullstack Ruby Developer seeking for my first web development role in Bristol/Bath/London. 

Previously from a background in technical consultancy with agile project delivery, I discovered a passion for web/software development during self-learning and decided to attend [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) to pursue a career in the field. 

I started learning on frontend development in my spare time since 2015. Always keeping myself up to date with the various frontend technologies, I enjoyed experimenting with various frontend technologies such as d3.js and Flexbox. 

Getting out of my comfort zone, I attended a Node workshop in London in early 2016. At the end of the workshop, I found that backend development is just as interesting as frontend development, which led to my decision to learn fullstack web development. During the course, I found a new love for Ruby on Rails however I am keen to explore React, other MVC frameworks and iOS development after the course. 

In my next role, I would love the opportunity to exploring ways to incorporating my previous experience in solution delivery management and my passion in crafting software. 

## Skills

#### Problem Solving & Critical Thinking
As a technical consultant, I have worked with large organisations which had complex IT infrastructure, involving outsourced agencies to complete their CRM(Customer Retention Marketing) goals and objectives. 

In projects I've worked on, we faced the challenge of finding a way of automating two or more web/IT systems to work with each other. As a consultant, I gathered information from relevant teams, read up documentation on various systems and software before commencing solution testing. 

Once my hypothesised solutions had been tested for discovery purposes, I presented each solution to the relevant teams and we worked towards to the agreed solution. 

Clients including:
- [giffgaff](http://giffgaff.com)
- [Pizza Hut Delivery](https://pizzahut.co.uk)
- [Surfdome](http://surfdome.co.uk) 

#### Communication
Recognising my natural aptitude in presentation and communication with either clients or colleagues, I was trained as a product/project manager between 2014 and 2016. I gained an Agile Project Manager Practitioner Certification in Feb 2016 and continued working heavily in CRM project management, along with my technical responsibilities in the projects. 

Outside of my 9-5, I gave an [introductory talk on Physical Web](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dkVVZCefEtuCmpVE6rQVt8q7YKrDGID793M5Mh138uA/edit?usp=sharing) at [Codebar Monthly](https://codebar.io/meetings/monthly-jun-2016) and [Women Hack for Non Profits Tech Talk](https://generalassemb.ly/education/women-hack-for-non-profits-tech-talks-evening) to introduce Physical Web and Eddystone beacons. Along with the talk slides, I have written a [blogpost](http://bit.ly/2hLOBkW) on the topic too. 

#### Team Mentality 
In week 5 of the Makers Academy course, I nominated myself as the of lead of the group project, which was to complete a minimum viable product of an Airbnb clone. My perseverance/ can do attitude was infectious, and the team worked hard together towards an end result we were all very pleased with, which was the working MVP of the clone. 

#### Mentoring
I am a mentor of a student whom started the Makers Academy course 6 weeks after I did. We often pair in evenings and have at least one technical discussion each week. During the course, I often take time out during my study hours to help other students with a range of education tools such as diagramming, delving into the topic using documentation, practical examples and more.
