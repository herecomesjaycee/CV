## [Jaycee Cheong] (https://herecomesjaycee.com)
Previously from a background in technical consultancy with agile project delivery, I discover a passion for web/software development and decided to attend [Maker's Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) to pursue a career in the field. 

## Skills

#### Analytics thinking - Problem Solving
Working as a technical consultant, I have worked with large organisations with complex IT infrastructure, involving outsourced agencies to complete their CRM projects.

I often face the challenge of finding a way of automating two or more IT systems to work with each other. I first gather information from relevant teams, reading up documentation on various systems and software before commencing solution testing. 

Once my hypothesised solutions had been tested for discovery purposes, I present back to my client on each solution and I will work with the teams towards to the agreed solution. 

Clients including:
- [giffgaff](http://giffgaff.com)
- [Pizza Hut Delivery](https://pizzahut.co.uk)
- [Surfdome](http://surfdome.co.uk) 

#### Communication
Recognising my natural flair in presentation and communication with either clients or colleagues, I was trained as a product/project manager between 2014 and 2016. I gained an Agile Project Manager Practitioner Certification in Feb 2016 and continued working heavily in CRM project management, along with my technical responsibilities in CRM projects. 

Outside of my 9-5, I have given introductory talks on Physical Web at [Codebar Monthly](https://codebar.io/meetings/monthly-jun-2016) and [Women Hack for Non Profits Tech Talk](https://generalassemb.ly/education/women-hack-for-non-profits-tech-talks-evening) to introduce Physical Web and Eddystone beacons. Along with the talks, I wrote a [blogpost](http://bit.ly/2hLOBkW) on this too.
