## [Jaycee Cheong] (https://herecomesjaycee.com)
I am a fullstack Ruby Developer seeking for her first web development role in London. 

Previously from a background in technical consultancy with agile project delivery, I discover a passion for web/software development and decided to attend [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) to pursue a career in the field. 

In my next role, I would love the opportunity to exploring ways to incorporating my previous experience in solution delivery management and my passion in crafting software. 

## Skills

#### Problem Solving & Critical Thinking
Working as a technical consultant, I have worked with large organisations with complex IT infrastructure, involving outsourced agencies to complete their CRM(Customer Retention Marketing) goals and objectives. 

In projects I've worked on, we face the challenge of finding a way of automating two or more web/IT systems to work with each other. As a consultant, I gather information from relevant teams, reading up documentation on various systems and software before commencing solution testing. 

Once my hypothesised solutions had been tested for discovery purposes, I presented each solution to the relevant teams and we work towards to the agreed solution. 

Clients including:
- [giffgaff](http://giffgaff.com)
- [Pizza Hut Delivery](https://pizzahut.co.uk)
- [Surfdome](http://surfdome.co.uk) 

#### Communication
Recognising my natural aptitude in presentation and communication with either clients or colleagues, I was trained as a product/project manager between 2014 and 2016. I gained an Agile Project Manager Practitioner Certification in Feb 2016 and continued working heavily in CRM project management, along with my technical responsibilities in the projects. 

Outside of my 9-5, I have given introductory talks on Physical Web at [Codebar Monthly](https://codebar.io/meetings/monthly-jun-2016) and [Women Hack for Non Profits Tech Talk](https://generalassemb.ly/education/women-hack-for-non-profits-tech-talks-evening) to introduce Physical Web and Eddystone beacons. Along with the talks, I wrote a [blogpost](http://bit.ly/2hLOBkW) on this too. 

#### Team Mentality 
In week 5 of the course, I nominated myself as the of lead of the group project, which was to complete a minimum viable product of an Airbnb clone. My perseverance/ can do attitude was infectious, and the team worked hard together towards an end result we all very pleased with. 

#### Mentoring
I am a mentor of a student whom started the Makers Academy course 6 weeks after I did. We often pair in the evening and answered any questions she had for the week. I often take time out during my study hours to help others in my course with a range of education tools such as diagramming, delving into the topic, creating easy to read examples and more.
