## [Jaycee Cheong](https://herecomesjaycee.com)
I currently work at [Simpleweb](https://www.simpleweb.co.uk) as a software developer working with a wide range of technologies/libraries and frameworks.

Previously from a background in technical consultancy with agile project delivery, I discovered a passion for web/software development during self-learning and decided to attend [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) to pursue a career in the field and have been working as a developer since May 2017.

Outside of my job, you'd find me organising/delivering coding or any tech related workshops, giving talks and mentoring students who are interested in software development.

In my next role, I would love the opportunity to learn from product companies to improve my knowledge on working with large scale applications.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving & Critical Thinking
At Simpleweb, I work with clients to understand the problem they are hoping to solve with their technical products, providing technical expertise and building the agreed solution. 

As a technical consultant, I have worked with large organisations which had complex IT infrastructure, involving outsourced agencies to complete their CRM(Customer Retention Marketing) goals and objectives. 

In projects I've worked on, we faced the challenge of finding a way of automating two or more web/IT systems to work with each other. As a consultant, I gathered information from relevant teams, read up documentation on various systems and software before commencing solution testing. 

Once my hypothesised solutions had been tested for discovery purposes, I presented each solution to the relevant teams and we worked towards to the agreed solution. 

Clients including:
- [giffgaff](http://giffgaff.com)
- [Pizza Hut Delivery](https://pizzahut.co.uk)
- [Surfdome](http://surfdome.co.uk) 

#### Communication
I enjoy giving talks on technical topics such as [Physical Web](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v4mEINciQ_u5nrX637Fim4S4ZfhcE4DppT7VezYBz6E), Elasticsearch and Neo4j at meetups, conferences and/or company's internal presentation

Recognising my natural aptitude in presentation and communication with either clients or colleagues, I was trained as a product/project manager between 2014 and 2016. I gained an Agile Project Manager Practitioner Certification in Feb 2016 and continued working heavily in CRM project management, along with my technical responsibilities in the projects. 


#### Mentoring
I often mentor students at [Codebar](https://www.codebar.io), [CodeFirstGirls](https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/) and some previous students at [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com).
